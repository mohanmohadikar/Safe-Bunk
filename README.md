# Safe bunk



## WHY TO USE THIS APP ?

#### Safe Bunk is a simple app which tells you the number of lectures you can bunk if your attendance is more than the required attendance criteria.It also tells you the number of lectures you should attend if your attendance is less than the attendance criteria. 

#### Fine print: This application DOES NOT PROMOTE bunking. The developer of this application IS NOT RESPONSIBLE for the user's attendance in university. :P
